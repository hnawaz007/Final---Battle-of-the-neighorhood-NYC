    "## 1. Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores Chinese cuisine in New York city. New York City (NYC) has two major hubs for Chinese food. Manhattan’s Chinatown spans roughly ten blocks between Canal Street and Worth Street. The second NYC hub is Flushing, Queens. New York is a major metropolitan area with more than 8.4 million (census.gov, 2019) people living within city limits. It has a population density of 28,000 residents per square mile.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Chinese immigration to the United States were restricted due to the Chinese Exclusion Act. After being revoked in 1943, the Chinese community slowly started growing. Today Chinatown in Manhattan has grown from the original ten blocks to the present inclusion of the once Italian and Jewish Lower East Side. The large influx of Cantonese-speaking Chinese immigrants caused the extension of the neighborhood. In the 1970s-80s, the influx of Guangdong and Hong Kong immigrants began to rapidly develop newer portions of Manhattan’s Chinatown, going north of Canal Street and then later the east of the Bowery.\n",
    "\n",
    "With almost 60,000 (mascaulay.cuny.ed, 2020) Manhattan inhabitants reporting Chinese ancestry, the need to find and enjoy Sichuan, Anhui, Cantonese, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Szechuan and Zhejiang and other Chinese cuisines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report explores which neighborhoods and boroughs of New York City have the most as well as the best Chinese restaurants as per FourSquare data. Additionally, I will attempt to answer the questions “Where should one open a Chinese Restaurant?” and “Where should one stay If he/she wants great Chinese food?”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Section\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the above questions, we need to accumulate data. The data on New York City neighborhoods, boroughs should include boundaries, latitude, longitude, restaurants, and restaurant ratings and tips. There are numbers of API/Websites that provide us with this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City data containing the neighborhoods and boroughs, latitudes, and longitudes will be obtained from the data source: https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City data containing neighborhood boundaries will be obtained from the data source: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm\n",
    "\n",
    "All data related to locations and quality of Chinese restaurants will be acquired from Foursquare via Foursquare API. We will utilize the Foursquare API with NYC neighborhoods data to request detailed restaurants data. For this we will use Request library in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Methodology Section\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data is collected from https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset and cleansed and processed into a dataframe.**\n",

    "\n",
    "**I used python folium library to visualize geographic details of NYC and its boroughs and I created a map of NYC with boroughs superimposed on top. I used latitude and longitude values to get the visual as below:**\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foursquare is used to locate all venues and then filter only for Chinese restaurants. Ratings, tips, and likes by users is counted and added to the dataframe.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*PJkLcIBGVj-1-nZsAnUTWQ.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**We sorted data and calculate average rating**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/1*XbEAlAHUuNPA4ItnLFiIeA.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finally, the data be will be visually assessed using bar graph and maps from various Python libraries such as matplotlib and folium. These are used in result section.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the best location for Chinese cuisine in New York City?\n",
    "2. In what neighborhood and/or borough should I open a Chinese restaurant to have the best chance of success?\n",
    "3. Where would I go in New York City to have the best Chinese food?\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan and Queens have the best rated Chinese restaurants on average. Queens slightly edges out Brooklyn in the ratings. Staten Island and The Bronx have the least number of Chinese restaurants per borough. It is no surprise that Manhattan’s Chinatown has the highest number of Chinese restaurants in NYC. While surprisingly ,Little Neck in Queens takes the lead in the highest number of Chinese restaurants. The obvious choice would be Flushing in Queens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Manhattan has the fewest number of neighborhoods it ranks third in terms of the number of Chinese restaurants (behind Queens and Brooklyn). Based on this information, I would state that Manhattan is the best location for Chinese cuisine in NYC. Rent and other factors notwithstanding, Manhattan could be considered the best location to open a new Chinese restaurant. Manhattan has most neighborhoods with average ratings exceeding 8.0 on a scale of 1.0 to 10.0 and it is still behind Brooklyn and Queens in number of Chinese restaurants making competition easier than in other two boroughs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I would go to Chelsea in Manhattan for the best Chinese food based on 1488 likes, Buddakan. As a final note, all the above analysis is depended on the accuracy of Foursquare data. A more comprehensive analysis and future work would need to incorporate data from other external databases.\n",
